    "The ideal spark plug gap recommended for the Hero MotoCorp SUPER SPLENDOR vehicle is 0.8-0.9 mm.",
    "Yes, the vehicle comes in a tubeless tyre version. As per the provided context, the tyre specifications mentioned are \"80/100-18 47P (Tubeless tyre)\" for the front (Disc variant) and \"90/90-18 51P (Tubeless tyre)\" for the rear (Disc variant).",
    "Is it compulsory to have a disc brake?\n\nAccording to the Vehicle Specification section, the front brake option is either Drum (variant) or Disc (variant). This implies that a disc brake is not compulsory, as there is an alternative drum brake option available.",
    "Based on the provided context, it is not recommended to put Thums Up instead of oil. The context provides information about the vehicle's specifications, maintenance, and safety precautions but does not mention using Thums Up as a substitute for oil.\n\nIn fact, the context emphasizes the importance of using genuine engine oil, such as Hero 4T Plus SAE 10W 30 SL grade (JASO MA2), to maintain the engine's performance and longevity. It also warns against using non-detergent, vegetable, or castor-based racing oils, which suggests that using an inappropriate substance like Thums Up could be harmful to the engine.\n\nTherefore, it is not advisable to put Thums Up instead of oil in the vehicle. If you have any concerns about the vehicle's maintenance or repair, it is recommended to consult the owner's manual or contact an authorized Hero MotoCorp workshop.",
    "Unfortunately, the provided context does not contain any information about generating a random number between 1 and 100 in JavaScript.\n\nHowever, I can provide a simple JavaScript code snippet that generates a random number between 1 and 100:\n\n```javascript\nfunction generateRandomNumber(min, max) {\n    return Math.floor(Math.random() * (max - min + 1)) + min;\n}\n\nconsole.log(generateRandomNumber(1, 100));\n```\n\nThis code defines a function `generateRandomNumber` that takes two arguments, `min` and `max`, and returns a random number between `min` and `max` (inclusive). The `Math.random()` function generates a random number between 0 and 1, which is then scaled to the desired range using the formula `(max - min + 1)`. The `Math.floor()` function is used to round down the result to the nearest integer.\n\nYou can call this function with the desired range, like `generateRandomNumber(1, 100)`, to generate a random number between 1 and 100."

So \\nalways wear a helmet and make sure your \\npillion rider does the same. We also \\nrecommend that you wear eye protection, \\nsturdy boots, gloves and other protective gear.\\nBefore riding your vehicle\\nMake sure that you are physically fit, mentally \\nfocused and free of alcohol and drugs. Check \\nthat you and your pillion are both wearing an \\napproved vehicle helmet and protective \\napparel. Instruct your pillion on holding onto \\nthe grab rail or your waist, leaning with you in \\nturns, and keeping their feet on the footrest, \\neven when the vehicle is stopped.\\nIMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION\\nThere is much that you can do to protect \\nyourself when you ride. You will find many \\nhelpful recommendations through out this \\nmanual. Following are a few that we consider \\nmost important.\\nAlways wear a helmet\\nEven if you have ridden other vehicles, \\npractice riding in a safe area to become \\nfamiliar with how this vehicle works and \\nhandles, and to become accustomed to the \\nvehicle\\'s size and weight.\\nVEHICLE SAFETY\\nAlways pay due attention to other vehicles \\naround you, and do not assume that other \\ndrivers see you. Be prepared to stop quickly or \\nperform an evasive maneuver.\\nSome drivers do not see vehicles because they \\nare not looking for them. To make yourself more \\nvisible, wear bright reflective clothing, position \\nyourself so that others can see you, signal before \\nturning or changing lanes, and use horn which \\nwill help others to notice you.\\nDo not drink and ride\\nRide defensively\\nMake yourself easily visible\\nRide within your limits\\nPushing the limits is another major cause of \\nvehicle accidents. Never ride beyond your \\npersonal abilities or faster than conditions \\ndemand. Remember that fatigue and \\nnegligence can significantly reduce your ability \\nto make good judgements and ride safely.\\nRiding under the influence of alcohol or drugs \\nis dangerous. Alcohol can reduce your ability \\nto respond to changing conditions and reduce \\nthe reaction time. Do not drink and ride. \\nKeep your vehicle in safe condition\\nFor safe riding, its important to inspect your \\nvehicle before every ride and perform all \\nrecommended maintenance. Never exceed \\nload limits, and use accessories that have been \\nrecommended by Hero MotoCorp for this \\nvehicle. \\n8\\n\\nYour helmet is your most important piece of \\nriding gear because it offers the best \\nprotection against head injuries. A helmet \\nshould fit your head comfortably and securely. \\nA bright coloured helmet can make you more \\nnoticeable in traffic, as can reflective strips.\\nIn addition to a helmet and eye protection, we \\nalso recommend:\\n• Leather gloves to keep your hands warm \\nand help prevent blisters, cuts, burns, and \\nbruises.\\nAn open-face helmet offers some protection, \\nbut a full-face helmet offers more. Always \\nwear face shield or goggles to protect your \\neyes and help your vision.\\nAdditional riding gear\\nHelmets and eye protection\\n• Sturdy boots with non-slip soles to help \\nprotect your feet and ankles.\\n• A two wheeler riding suit or jacket for \\ncomfort as well as protection. Bright \\ncoloured reflective clothing can help make \\nyou more noticeable in traffic. Be sure to \\navoid loose clothes that could get caught on \\nany part of your vehicle. \\nPROTECTIVEAPPAREL\\n \\nFollowing are suggestions to help you choose \\nproper riding  gear. \\nPersonal safety is your first priority. If you or \\nanyone else has been injured, take time to \\nassess the severity of the injuries and whether \\nit is safe to continue riding. Call for emergency \\nassistance if needed. Also follow applicable \\nlaws and regulations if another person or \\nvehicle is involved in the crash.\\nIf you decide to continue riding, first evaluate \\nthe condition of your vehicle. If the engine is \\nstill running, turn it off. Inspect for fluid leaks, \\ncheck the tightness of critical nuts and bolts, \\nand check the handlebar, brake levers, brakes, \\nand wheels. Ride slowly and cautiously. Your \\nvehicle may have suffered damage that is not \\nimmediately apparent. Have your vehicle \\nthoroughly checked at a qualified service \\nfacility as soon as possible.\\nIf you are involved in a crash\\nFor your safety, we strongly recommend that \\nyou always wear an approved helmet (ISI \\nmarked), eye protection, boots, gloves, long \\npants and a long sleeve shirt or jacket \\nwhenever you ride. Take care of loose/ \\nhanging clothes while solo/pillion riding. \\nAlthough complete protection is not possible, \\nwearing proper gear can reduce the chance of \\ninjury when you ride. \\n• Not wearing a helmet increases the chance of \\nserious injury or death in a crash. \\n• Be sure you and your pillion always wear a \\nhelmet, eye protection and other protective \\napparel when you ride.\\nWARNING\\n!!\\n9\\n\\n• To make yourself more visible, wear bright \\nreflective clothing that fits well.\\n• Always conduct simple pre-ride inspection \\n(page 28).\\n• Respect road signs and obey traffic rules for \\nyour own safety and that of others on the \\nroad (page 71).\\n• Always wear a helmet (ISI marked) with \\nchin strap securely fastened and insist on a \\nhelmet for your pillion rider.\\n• Give way to others on the road and signal \\nbefore you make a turn.\\n• To stop the vehicle (in IBS), press the rear \\nbrake pedal for the application of front and \\nrear brakes simultaneously. However, for \\nmore effective braking, use both brakes \\nsimultaneously, keeping throttle in the \\nclosed position.\\n• Before riding make sure in which mode you \\nare riding whether with i3s switch “ON” or \\n“OFF”.\\n• Ride defensively and at a steady speed \\n(between 40-50 km/hr).\\n• While riding, sit in a comfortable position \\nwith your legs close to fuel tank.\\n• During night time, dip headlamps of your \\nvehicle for oncoming traffic, or when \\nfollowing another vehicle.\\n• Tightly wrap loose/hanging clothes & avoid \\nentangling with moving parts.\\nDo\\'s:\\n• Get your vehicle serviced regularly by the \\nAuthorised Hero MotoCorp workshop.\\nDon\\'t\\n• Never use cell phone while riding the      \\nvehicle.\\n• Avoid sudden acceleration, braking and \\nturning of your  vehicle.\\n• Never ride under the influence of alcohol or \\ndrugs.\\n• Do not litter the road.\\n• Never shift gears without disengaging the \\nclutch and closing the throttle.\\n• Do not cross the continuous white/yellow \\nline in the center of the road, while \\novertaking.\\n• Never touch any part of the hot exhaust      \\nsystem like muffler.\\n• Do not attach large or heavy items to the      \\nhandlebars, front forks, or fenders.\\n• Never take your hands off the steering \\nhandle while riding.\\n• Do not move the side stand down while \\nriding, as engine will stop while vehicle is in \\ngear (page 23) (Wheel locking leading to \\naccident, part damage etc.).\\n• Concentrate on the road and avoid talking \\nto the pillion rider or others on the road.\\nSAFE RIDING TIPS\\n10\\n\\n11\\nThe following tips shall ensure a healthy vehicle, healthy environment, and a healthy you.\\n• Emission pollution: Get emission of your vehicle checked by Authorised agencies atleast \\nonce every 3 months or as notified by the government from time to time.\\n• Genuine engine oil: Hero 4T Plus SAE 10W 30 SL grade (JASO MA2) engine oil \\nrecommended by Hero MotoCorp and make sure you change it every 6000 km. (with \\ntop up every 3000 kilometres) to keep the engine fit and environment healthy.\\n• Healthy engine: The engine is the lifeline of every vehicle. To keep it healthy, it should be \\ntuned regularly, which will also help reduce pollution and improve vehicle performance & \\nfuel efficiency.\\n• Genuine spares: Always insist on Hero MotoCorp genuine parts as spurious or \\nincompatible spares and accessories can upset or deteriorate your vehicle’s running \\ncondition.\\n• Noise pollution : Noise beyond a certain decibel is pollution. Whether it is from horns or \\ndefective mufflers, excessive noise will cause headaches and discomfort.\\n• Fuel saving & Reduce pollution : Switch \"OFF\" the engine while waiting at traffic signal \\npoints to save fuel and reduce pollution, if the waiting period is long.\\n• BS-VI grade fuel : Always use BS-VI grade fuel to adhere BS-VI norms. \\n• Regular servicing: Get your vehicle serviced at an Authorised Hero MotoCorp \\nworkshop, as per the service schedule, for an optimum performance and keep the emission \\nlevel under check.\\nTIPS FOR HEALTHY ENVIRONMENT\\n\\n12\\nKey cannot be removed\\nEngine cannot be started and no electrical \\nsystem will be functional.\\nKey can be removed\\nKey can be removed\\nKey removal\\nSteering can be locked.\\nFunction\\nKey position\\n “LOCK”\\n“ON” (   ) \\n“OFF”(   ) \\n1\\n(1) Ignition switch\\n(2) Ignition key\\n(3) Steering lock position\\nPARTS FUNCTION\\nIgnition switch\\n“LOCK” position\\n“ON” (    )\\nposition\\n“OFF”(    ) \\nposition/\\nLock open\\n2\\n3\\nThe engine can be started, turn signal lamps, \\nhorn, tail/stop lamp and passing switch can be \\noperated.
